# Happy Plant - Static Comp Challenge

A solo challenge by [Michann Stoner](https://github.com/michannstoner). Original project spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/m1-static-comp).


### Overview 
Happy Plant is a static comp challenge, designed to resemble a provided comp but with creative freedom with colors, icons, and images. It is intended to practice utilizing grid, flex-box, and responsive layouts. Happy Plant is a mock plant care application, where users can get more information about plants, track their own plants watering cycles, and more.

### Project Wins & Challenges 
#### Wins

I really enjoyed getting some more practice with HTML and CSS for this quick static-comp project. I was able to get my grid set up faster than in previous projects, and felt much more comfortable building out the overall design than before. 

#### Challenges 

I'd say something that is challenging for me still is responsive design and breakpoints. I designed for desktop first, which caused some issues when trying to downsize later on. In future projects, I want to attempt mobile first, and try to set more breakpoints for a more responsive experience. I wasn't quite able to get the page title 'Happy Plant' to scale the way I wanted, and I'd like to revisit that at a later point to correct it.
